Containers vs VM
    VM
        Many Guest OSs over one Host OS
        Guest Depends on Host OS
    Docker
        Docker Engine on Host
        No guest OS
        Independant from OS
        OS-level virtualization

VS Code
    connect EC2-user
        setup a new virtual environment
        copy your app to EC2 Host (drag&drop)
        in Terminal
            >sudo yum update -y
            >sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker -y
            >sudo systemctl start docker
            >sudo systemctl enable docker
            >sudo docker ps        #show running containers
            >sudo docker ps -a      #show all containers
            >sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user   #give admin auth to our docker
            >newgrp docker
            that ended env session

            >docker container ls
            >docker pull ubuntu #install ubuntu for my environment
            >docker image ls    #list my new ubuntu image
            activate environment again
            >docker run -it --name myubuntu ubuntu #create a new container including my ubuntu image (name it as myubuntu [optional])
            now we're in our new container
                if there's not python, we should install it
                >apt-get update -y      #install ubuntu update (-y >> yes prompt)
                >apt-get install python3
                >apt-get install python3-pip
                >pip3 install pandas
                close terminal (X) veya >exit

            we're in ec2-user bash terminal
            >sudo docker ps     #check docker
            as you see there's no docker container
            make a new shell file (docker_runner.sh)
            in the docker_runner.sh
                    #!/bin/sh
                    sudo yum update -y
                    sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker -y
                    sudo service docker start
                    sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
                    newgrp docker
                    systemctl enable docker
            >sh docker_runner.sh       #run our new .sh file
            >docker start myubuntu   #run my container
            >docker ps  #i can see my ubuntu container running
            >docker attach myubuntu     #attach to my container/we can also use the first 3 digits of container id

            we're in docker container now
            >apt-get install vim -y     #install a text file editor
            >vim test_file.txt      #my new file
            >cat test_file.txt
            we're in the file now
                write something for testing
                if the container is destroyed, this file will be gone
                So, we need to process our container with a volume
                press  > esc > : > w > q (to save and quit file)
            we're in terminal (container) again
            >ls -lhtr       #list all files in our systemctl

--- volume setup for content safety---
        in ec2-user terminal
            >docker run -it -d --name mycontainer2 ubuntu    #a new container
            #-d > detach flag, so we are out of new container
            still in ec2-user
            >docker ps      #list running containers
            we see our new container running
            >docker ps -a   #list all
            we see that our prev container listed
            >docker attach mycontainer2
            
            we're in our new container (ubuntu env)
            >apt-get install update -y      #setup my new system
            >mkdir my_dat && cd my_data     #create a new folder and open
            >vim test_file2.txt
            >cat test_file2.txt
                    shft + A > edit mode
                    write something
                    esc > :wq
                that saved our file
            we're back in ubuntu shell terminal
            exit
        in ec2-user bash terminal
        >docker volume ls   #check if we have any volume
        we don't have any volume yet.
        >docker volume create my_volume     #make a new volume
        >docker volume ls       #list volumes
        >docker volume inspect my_volume
        i see the info about my volume
        mountpoint > path is important copy that path (call it my_path)
        >sudo ls my_path
        there is no file in the path location
        >docker run -itd -v my_volume:/my_folder --name mycontainer3 ubuntu
        # it will create a new container attached to my new volume
        >docker attach mycontainer3
            we're in container now
            >apt-get update -y
            >apt-get install vim -y
            >cd my_folder           #my folder is already there
            >vim test_file3.txt
                    shft + a
                    write something
                    esc > :wq
            >exit
        in ec2-user
        >docker ps
        >docker volume ls
        >docker volume inspect my_volume
        >docker ps -a
        >docker start container3
        in ec2-user
        >sudo cat my_path/my_folder/test_file3.txt
        # that will list the content of my file
        now if we destroy our container, the files/content of it will stay
